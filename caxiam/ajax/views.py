# an AJAX form view class that handles multiple forms at once
#
# This is similar to AjaxFormView except that it explicitly
# expects multiple forms to be included on the page. Generally
# these will be submitted to separate URLs, but this is not a
# requirement and this class provides some semi-automatic
# routing of form processing. To enable this, you must
# include in EACH form a hidden form_alias field, the value
# of which will be supplied by the boilerplate.
#
# When deriving from this view, you must provide:
#   template_name   an HTML template path
#   form_classes    a dict; keys are form aliases (relevant
#                   only to the view and its template) and
#                   values are tuples with these elements:
#     form_class    a form class (a reference to the class,
#                   not just the name as a string)
#     helper_attrs  a dict of attrs applied to the Crispy
#                   form helper object as attributes (not
#                   to be confused with the Crispy attrs
#                   attribute)
#                   (of special note is form_action, the
#                   URL to which the form will be POSTed)
#     target_url    where to go after a POST of this form
#                   succeeds; if None, uses view default
#     form_attrs    a dict of additional parameters to
#                   pass to the form object during creation
#                   (optional)
#
# This class does not derive from AjaxFormView but rather
# directly from AjaxView. There is significant code overlap,
# though. The prepare_context, prepare_form, and process_form
# methods can be customized per form by appending _<alias>
# to the respective function. On POST, the default handler
# will look for a POSTed element of form_alias which MUST be
# included; if it matches one of the form aliases in the view,
# process_form will be routed to that custom function if it
# exists.
#
# NOTE: since form aliases are used to construct Python
# method names, you should use standard Python style for them.
#
# NOTE: on GET requests, ALL forms are processed; on POST
# requests, only ONE form can be processed (because only one
# is submitted by the browser).
#
# NOTE: if you care about the order in which forms are
# processed, pass in a SortedDict for form_classes instead
# of a dict.
