# form validation error messages
#
# included as a separate file so that they are easily modifiable
# by people who are not necessarily Python experts; it also makes
# it very easy to replace and/or translate
#
# Django's suggestion of abusing the translation system just to
# sub in different error messages is as idiotic as their isolation
# of validation error texts from the context in which they are
# applied.
#
# When writing error messages, do not use passive-aggressive
# language; be clear and direct without being insulting or snide.
# Each error message should include __fieldname__ as the
# placeholder for the field name; this won't be replaced by Django,
# but rather by our own code on the client side. Some error messages
# may have other placeholders that are filled in with data from the
# validator.
#
# Some messages are given as a tuple instead of as a single string.
# These are handed off to ungettext_lazy once the value is known
# for pluralization. Not ideal, but acceptable.
#
# Within each grouping, PLEASE keep the list alphabetized by name.
# This will make finding and verifying entries easier without risk
# of missing duplicate entries.
