# form mixin class that provides enhanced validation with two
# major new features:
#
#   1. Partial validation, so that forms can be validated
#      up to and including a specified field. This allows us
#      to immediately give a response to the user when they
#      tab out of a field whether it was valid.
#
#   2. Inter-field validation, so that rules can be written
#      to verify relationships between fields (ordering,
#      dependency, etc.).
#
#      To use inter-field validation, define a form clean
#      method and invoke the rule methods to do the
#      validation and generate appropriate error messages.
#      To override error messages, define a name for the
#      rule and include the error message in the usual
#      place.
#
#      NOTE: although inter-field validation is done AFTER
#      all single fields are validated, because the error
#      messages are added to the affected fields, they will
#      be presented in-order to the user. We tinker with
#      the messages so that it will appear after the LAST
#      affected field, not the first.

# It turns out that rewriting error messages is HARD. Django's

#
#   full_clean

#                               and store any errors (simple or
#                               list) in an ErrorList
#
#           clean               Field-specific validation, most
#                               use the outline below except
#                               multi-field types. May return a
#                               list or a simple type.
#
#               to_python       Convert the string input to an
#                               appropriate Python objects. May
#                               raise a ValidationError; all Django
#                               built-in types raise error/code.
#
#               validate        Invoke the field type-specific
#                               validator and raise ValidationError
#                               in case of problems. Django's
#                               built-in types return simple
#                               error/code types. Looks for errors
#                               on the object (default is assembled
#                               from default error messages for all
#                               the classes in the hierarchy).
#
#               run_validators  Invoke individual validators and
#                               collect all the ValidationError
#                               objects into a list, then turn that
#                               into a list-style ValidationError.
#                               Catches ValidationError internally
#                               and rewrites the message if it
#                               matches one set for the field.
#   
#                   validator   Invoke the validator and raise
#                               ValidationError in case of problems.
#                               None of Django's validators raise
#                               a ValidationError with more than a
#                               simple error/code, but it's possible.
#                               Error strings generated by validators
#                               are not automatically rewritten per-
#                               field, but are done in the calling
#                               code.
#
#       clean_form              Form-wide validation code that is
#                               specific to the form. A ValidationError
#                               raised here will be placed in the
#                               __all__ bucket but will also stop
#                               additional validation taking place;
#                               more useful is to write errors into
#                               the _errors dict manually.
#
# Any of these steps may raise a ValidationError, but clean_fields
# will collect those into buckets for each specific field, and
# clean_form collects those into an __all__ bucket. All of the
# message strings are re-written with field-specific ones (even
# those raised from validators, which do not know the field context
# in which they are being used).
#
# ValidationError e gets serialized to string(s) at these times:
#
#   e.messages  converts dict/list of ValidationErroritems into
#               strings, then returns the list
#               NOTE: always returns a list, even if just one item
#
#   e.message_diict flattens nested dict/list ValidationErrors
#               into a single list per field, forcing each item
#               to string
#
# Our challenge is to rewrite the messages to be less passive-
# aggressive, including the field label in the text. To do this
# we wait until the field's error_messages dict is populated, then
# attempt to rewrite all the entries. We will throw an exception
# if we encounter a message that we do not have a replacement for.
# We must do this BEFORE any validation occurs as Django's built-
# in message rewriting for validators assumes the error messages
# are in place at that moment; once ValidationError has been
# serialized to strings it is too late for anything except the
# blunt instrument of the translation engine (which is a different
# rant, but a terrible idea).
#
# One hole is that if Django forgets to list an error message yet
# still includes the validator; this would allow the generic
# validator email message to bleed through until we found and
# fixed it.
#
# NOTE: you MUST provide a label for EVERY form field. This is
# required and this class will throw an exception if you miss one.
# The error messages cannot be rewritten properly if you do not
# do this. This applies even to fields for which the label isn't
# shown on the form.
#
# NOTE: we automatically include CrispyMixin to set up a form
# helper object without requiring extra steps. See
# caxiam.forms.CrispyMixin for more details.
